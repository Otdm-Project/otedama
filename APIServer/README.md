## 😵‍💫 Surprisingly, WEB deployment is a hassle...
Have you ever deployed a website?

There are various websites in the world.

You all must be accessing various websites daily.

Using Google for research, accessing Yahoo for checking the news, etc...

However, before such websites are deployed, they need to go through various procedures.

## ✅ Steps to WEB Deployment
### 1. 👩‍💻 Creating a Website
First, we need to create it.

We create it using programming languages like HTML and JS.

### 2 . 🖥️ Hosting the Site on a WEB Server
After creating the website, add it to programs called WEB servers such as Apache and nginx.

### 3. 🌐 Configuring the Network with the WEB Server
As the first step in making the WEB server public, settings for public access need to be added to the network where the WEB server is located.

Due to the convenience of public access, these settings unavoidably weaken security.

### 4. 🅰️ Acquiring a Domain
When you access the WEB, how do you do it?

Many people may not be aware of it.

Generally, to access a website, we use something called a domain.

For example, when you want to access Google, you enter google.com in the address bar.

This google.com is a domain.

To publish a WEB, we basically acquire this domain.

Acquiring a domain incurs costs.

### 5. 🔑 Managing Domain Certificates
Just acquiring a domain is not enough.

After acquiring a domain, we need to introduce something called a certificate to the WEB server.

As the name suggests, a certificate proves that this domain belongs to you.

To prevent domain spoofing, we need to introduce it.

Furthermore, using this certificate enables encrypted communication, that is, HTTPS communication.

There are various certificates available, from free ones to paid ones, but all of them have an expiration date, similar to a best-before date.

When this deadline expires, the certificate becomes invalid, and secure communication and WEB deployment become impossible.

Therefore, WEB administrators need to manage certificate operations.

## Ah, it's such a hassle...
As you can see, there are various procedures required to deploy a WEB.

While setting up a WEB server is not that difficult, beyond that, you need knowledge of various areas and operations of equipment other than servers.

So, we have created a service that allows WEB deployment without worrying about these hurdles.

**That's Otedama.**

With Otedama, you can deploy a WEB without going through steps 3 to 5.

It's software that makes WEB deployment easy just by introducing it to clients.
